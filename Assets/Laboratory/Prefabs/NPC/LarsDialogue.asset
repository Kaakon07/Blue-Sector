    - Welcome to the Fish Labratory. Here you will check the quality of the fish.
    - This is done through multiple steps. First  you will have to measure the fish,
      then disect it and check it's qualities.

    - First you will measure the weight and length of the fish. This is important
      to figure out it's condition factor.

    - The first step is measuring it's weight, this is done by using the weight 
      on the table.
    - First place the basket on top of the weight, then turn it on. Then place the
      fish on the basket. Remember to take note of the weight.
    - You may need to reset the scale to make sure that it shows zero before placing
      the fish on the scale
    - The next step is measuring the fish's length. This is done by using the tool
      to the right of the weight.
    - 'Make sure the fish is straight and it''s head is placed beside the wall on
      the left of the tool. Then take note of the length. '
    - Now you need to calculate the condition factor of the fish. This is done by
      dividing the weight with the lenght of the fish three times, then multiplying
      by a hundred.
    - If the condition factor of the fish is below 1 it has bad quality.

    - 'Next you will dissect the fish. Place the fish on the cutting board to the
      right of the length measurer. '
    - The first step is checking for any external damages or errors on the fish.
      Check the skin, fins and gills to make sure there are no health issues.
    - The next step is inspecting the internal areas of the fish. Cut open the fish
      according to the instructions.
    - 'Look after any internal bleeding or discoloration on the fish organs or any
      other damages. '
    - Remember to be careful when handling the fish to avoid causing any damage.
