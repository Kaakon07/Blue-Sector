    - The fish laboratory is important for getting information on the health of the
      fish. This information is used to better regulate the feeding and treatment
      of the fish. And to ensure that the fish welfare is good by cheking for any
      sickness or other health issues.
    - In the laboratory the condition factor of the fish is calculated which is used
      to determine how well fed the fish is, and it is important for regulating the
      feeding of the fish
    - The fish is dissected to see if there are any issues with the fish, like sickness
      or damages
    - The living conditions of the fish are also checked  by analyzing different
      plankton samples in the microscope, as some plankton can be harmful for the
      fish.
