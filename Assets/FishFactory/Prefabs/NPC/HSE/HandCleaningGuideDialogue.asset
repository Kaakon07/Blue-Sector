    - Hello and welcome! Thank you for wanting to try to experience how it is to
      work at a fish processing facility!
    - You are currently in the preparation room. Behind the doors further in, you
      can find a selection of different tasks found in a fish processing facility.
    - But before you choose a task you want to experience, you first  need to make
      sure you follow the health and safety guidelines.
    - First and foremost, you need to ensure you properly protect your ears and feet.
      I have prepared some equipment for you here.
    - Secondly, you need to ensure you have clean hands. You can clean your hands
      in the specialized cleaning machine here! Just put your hands into the machine
      and let the machine do the rest! When you're finished, go to my colleague over
      by the shoe cleaner.
