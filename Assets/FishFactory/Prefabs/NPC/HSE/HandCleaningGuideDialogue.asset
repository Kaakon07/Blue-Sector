    - 'Hello, and welcome to the fish processing plant. You can find the different
      jobs behind the doors further in. '
    - From here you can choose between many different jobs and tasks found when working
      with fish processing. But before you choose a job you want to experience, you
      first  need to make sure you follow the health and safety guidelines.
    - First and foremost, you need to ensure you have clean hands. You can clean
      your hands in the specialized cleaning machine here! Just put your hands into
      the machine and let the machine do the rest! When you're finished, go to my
      colleague over by the shoe cleaner.
