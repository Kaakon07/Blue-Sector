    - Hello, and welcome to the quality assurance station. Your task here is to correctly
      sort fish by quality categories.
    - The fish on the conveyour belt next to me, comes from a cooling tank where
      the fish bleeds out. Please step on the platform next to me, to use the sorting
      machine.
    - To correctly sort fish, put the fish in the booth of the sorting machine and
      press the correct button to decide if the fish is of superior or lower quality.
