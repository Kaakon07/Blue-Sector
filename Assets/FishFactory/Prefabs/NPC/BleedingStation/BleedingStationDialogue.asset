    - You will find a stunning machine beside the station where you stand. Insert
      live fish into the machine, and the fish will be stunned. After that, the fish
      is ready to be cut.
    - Sometimes fish that is not eligble for human consumption can come down the
      conveyor belt. This unedible fish should be thrown in the tub next to you.
