    - Hello and welcome! Thank you for trying the fish processing facility experience!
    - Before you can proceed to the bleeding station or the quality assurance room,
      you first need to make sure you follow the health and safety guidelines.
    - You can start by washing your hands in the machine to the left of the gate.
      When you have done that you can come back to me for more info.

    - Once your hands are clean, it is important to wear proper gloves for the tasks
      ahead. In the bleeding station you are required to wear one steel glove on
      your non-dominant hand, and a regular blue one on the other.
    - Secondly, you need to ensure you protect your ears and feet. I have prepared
      some equipment for you on the table ahead.
    - The shoes might be a little dirty so you might need to wash them and put them
      on the drying rack.
