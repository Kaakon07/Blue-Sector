    - Hello and welcome! Thank you for trying the fish processing facility experience!
    - Before you can proceed to the bleeding station or the quality assurance room,
      you first need to make sure you follow the health and safety guidelines.
    - "First and foremost, you need to ensure you have clean hands. \nYou can clean
      your hands by inserting them in the specialized cleaning machine here! The
      gate will then open and let your through to your next task."
    - Once clean, it is important to wear proper gloves for the tasks ahead. In the
      bleeding station you are required to wear one steel glove on your non-dominant
      hand, and a regular blue one on the other.
    - Secondly, you need to ensure you protect your ears and feet. I have prepared
      some equipment for you on the table ahead.
