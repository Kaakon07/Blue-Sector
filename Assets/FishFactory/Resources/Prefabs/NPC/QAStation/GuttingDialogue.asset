    - Hello, and welcome to the gutting station. Your task here is to correctly sort
      incomplete or badly gutted fish.
    - The box next to me contains the gutting machine. It is highly automatic, but
      sometimes the gutting of the fish is not up to our standards, and require manual
      gutting.
    - When you see a fish that has not been properly gutted, push the button and
      send it to on the other conveyor belt be manually gutted. Properly gutted fish
      should be kept on the conveyor belt they are orignally.
    - Should you encounter any fish which has been badly gutted, you should be discarded
      and thrown into the box next to you. Make sure to flip the fish and check both
      sides for damages.
    - When you are ready, start by pressing the blue button next to the gutting machine.
