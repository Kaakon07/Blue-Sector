  - dialogue:
    - Hello, and welcome to the quality assurance station. Your task here is to correctly
      sort fish by quality categories.
    - The fish on the conveyour belt comes from a cooling tank where the fish bleeds
      out. Please step on the platform next to me to use the sorting machine.
    - You use the three buttons on the panel to sort the fish. The closest button
      is for the highest quality fish, called superior. The middle button is for
      lower quality fish that does not meet the requirements to be superior. Finally
      the third button, the button farthest from you is for the lowest quality fish.
    - You do not need to push a button for each fish you sort. The button that was
      last pressed is the tier the fish will be sorted into. If you find a fish that
      is not the same tier as the fish you last sorted then you need to press the
      corresponding button to change the tier to the correct one.

    - After the fish is sorted, it is gutted by the machine on the other side of
      the room. There you will need to manually control the fish for incomplete guttings,
      or poor quality. My friend Geralt will help you when you feel finished here.
      He is waiting over by the gutting machine.
    - Flip the fish to check both sides for damages, and press the button to sort
      out the bad fish.
