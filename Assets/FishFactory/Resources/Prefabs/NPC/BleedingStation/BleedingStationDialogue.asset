    - You will find the knife in your right pocket. When the knife is not in use
      it should be placed back into your pocket.
    - Remember always cut away from you and never towards anyone else. All the knives
      will be collected at the end of the day.
    - You may see the knife chip. If that happens you need to stop the conveyor and
      discard any fish that have metal fragments in them.
    - Once the fish with metal in them have been discarded you need to discard the
      knife and pick up a new one on the table behind me before you can continue.

  - dialogue:
    - The fish on the conveyor belt is stunned and feel no pain. If a fish shows
      signs of conciousness, this fish needs to be stunned before it is cut and bled.
    - You can recognize concious fish by their movement
    - You will find a stunning machine beside the station where you stand. Insert
      live fish into the machine with their head first, and the fish will be stunned.
      After that, the fish is ready to be cut.
    - Sometimes fish that is not eligble for human consumption can come down the
      conveyor belt. This unedible fish should be thrown in the tub next to you.

      - answerLabel: Yes! Stun concious fish before cutting them, and throw away
          bad fish.
        nextElement: 6
  - dialogue:
    - Make sure you cut only the gills. The cut should not go to deep into the fish.
    - You will be graded based on how accurate you cut the fish, along with whether
      that fish is stunned or alive when you cut it. And remember, bad fish should
      be discarded!
    - 'All fish must be cut before it moves to the next station! '
