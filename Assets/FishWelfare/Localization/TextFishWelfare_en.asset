    m_Localized: "In this simulation you will count lice and check for gill disease
      on four salmon. Before you can do that, you have to anesthetize them, and after
      that you have to put them in the wake-up tank. Remember to be careful when
      handling the fish. \nGood luck!"

    m_Localized: It is important not to pick up the fish until it is calm. You must
      have approx. 30 ml anesthetic per 100 liters of seawater. If the fish receives
      too much anesthesia or is sedated for too long, it can be injured. It should
      not be sedated for more than five minutes.

      1 is a little discoloration and 5 is a lot. If the gills look healthy, you
      do not need to give a score. \nAlso count salmon lice on the fish. They look
      like brown spots on the skin."
